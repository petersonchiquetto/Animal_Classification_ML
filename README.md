# Animal_Classification_ML 🐶🐷

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying animals like pigs 🐷 and dogs 🐶. Explore the code and learn how accurate animal classification is achieved! 

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, you will learn how to:

* **Understand supervised learning and binary classification:** Grasp the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, where a model learns from labeled data to predict outcomes, and binary classification, where the goal is to classify inputs into one of two categories (in this case, pig or dog).
* **Utilize item characteristics for class definition:** Learn how to define classes based on specific characteristics of items (animals, in this project).
* **Estimate classes of new items using estimators:** Apply the concept of estimators to predict the class of new, unseen items based on their characteristics.
* **Apply the scikit-learn library and the `LinearSVC` class:** Use scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, and its `LinearSVC` class to create an estimator for classification.
* **Calculate model accuracy using the `accuracy_score` function:** Evaluate the performance of the classification model by calculating its accuracy using the `accuracy_score` function.

## Features

* **Animal classification:** Distinguishes between pigs 🐷 and dogs 🐶 based on provided features.
* **Machine learning:** Utilizes the `LinearSVC` model from scikit-learn for classification. 🧠
* **Accuracy calculation:** Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model. 💯

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The programming language used for the algorithm. 🐍
* **scikit-learn:** A powerful and versatile machine learning library for Python, providing tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. 🤖

## Code Overview

The code defines features (long hair, short legs, and barking) and creates datasets for pigs 🐷 and dogs 🐶 based on these features. It then trains a `LinearSVC` model from scikit-learn on this data and predicts the class of a mystery animal. ⁉️ Finally, it evaluates the model's accuracy using the `accuracy_score` function.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you need to have Python and scikit-learn installed. You can then copy and paste the code into a Python file or Jupyter Notebook and run it. 🚀

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 66.67% on the test data. 🎉
